# Install Git

> To be able to manage your source control and connect with Github, you will need to have git installed.  

To check if you already have git installed run:

```sh
git --version
```

You should see something like:

```sh
git version 2.39.3
```

If it's not installed, you will need to install it from Homebrew.  (If you haven't previously installed homework follow the [Install Homebrew Instructions](./install_homebrew.md))

To install git, run:

```sh
brew install git
```

To verify that git is installed, run:

```sh
git --version
```
