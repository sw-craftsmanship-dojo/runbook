# Install Homebrew

>Homebrew is a prerequisite on macOS.  It can be used to install other packages that you may need to use.

To install Homebrew - the package manager, the simplest way to do it is to open your terminal and run:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

For other installation options, you can follow [the Homebrew installation guide](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
